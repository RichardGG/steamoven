# Who?

Hi! My name is Natalia and I'm a graphic designer and sessional academic at Grififth University. My passion is design and I'm always seeking a challenge. I also specialise in vector illustration as I love to include my own flare in design when possible!

I am proficient in Illustrator, InDesign and Photoshop, focusing mainly on corporate branding and product packaging design. I always look for new things to learn, so my list will be ever expanding in the years to come. Please make yourself at home!
