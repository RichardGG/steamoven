# Zeeps Carry Solutions

As part of my Industry Practice course during my studies, I was to create a product as part of an entrepreneurial strategy. Using my graphic design skills, I decided to steer away from the "usual" projects like t-shirts or posters. I decided to step outside my comfort zone and tackle a three-dimentional products.

Zeeps is a new kind of company that specialises in using recylced materials (in limited quantities as per particular materials being available) to produce a product that's "new" to the consumer. This is to tackle the issue of the societal over-consumption of clothing/fashion goods, and thus the overabundance of clothing being discarded prematurely. Using materials found in second hand stores, I set out to make six different prototypes of varying sizes: small, medium and large.
