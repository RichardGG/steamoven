  My work relationship with Gold Coast City Marina & Shipyard began as an
  internship six months before I was due to graduate. My task, alongside an
  experienced marketing executive, was to create a 70\+ page, annual Marina
  magazine. From scratch, we had completed the project in two months and had
  thousands of copies printed, for distribution locally and globally. I was
  given other tasks during this time, which spanned from re-creating flyers and
  informative pamphlets, to creating advertisements for the other tenants of the
  marina.


  I was then taken in for a casual position, where I was given the task of
  branding the new restaurant, Quarterdeck, opening next door to the main
  administration building at the marina. My first creation was the logo, which
  is still in use, and is located on the storefront, print media, social media
  and apron/uniforms.
