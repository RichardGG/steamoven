# Vector Illustration

Since beginning my graphic design studies, I always enjoyed illustration with simpler methods (drawing on paper and using Photoshop). However, after discovering Adobe Illustrator, it has been a wonderous journey of learning new tricks and utilising many of the hundreds of tools to create images that sprout from a simple idea in my mind. 

With the help of InDesign, these are some of the artworks I have created over the years.
